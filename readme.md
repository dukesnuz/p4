### App Name: Administrator

This app is called Administrator. This is the admin section for the dispatch app to be created in the future. The admin app will allow administrators to add, read, edit and delete dispatch offices and contacts for each office. As of this version only a dispatch office can be soft deleted. A mail feature allows mail campaigns to be sent to all contacts who have not been soft deleted. An input form to add addresses for each contact and a delete or active/non active feature will be added for each contact.

This app will also have two other sections created for carriers and shippers. These sections will also be the administrator sections for two other apps called carriers and shippers.
