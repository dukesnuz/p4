### App Name: Dispatch

This app is called Dispatch. The app will be created for freight brokers also know as dispatchers. The app will allow a dispatcher to bring all the needed information together for each freight shipment also known as a load. The app will allow the dispatcher to email, text or fax the needed information to the customer, carrier and driver. In the future I would like this app to have email campaigns. Such as a campaign to email custoemrs reminding them of our service and a campaign to email available loads to carriers.
